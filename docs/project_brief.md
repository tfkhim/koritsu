# Project brief

This Github application helps developers to implement the
[Koritsu workflow](https://debitoor.com/blog/trunk-based-development-how-we-fixed-it-with-koritsu).

## Goals

- Make it easy to push a ready branch
- Users should not need to care about merging the ready branches
- Handle concurrently pushed ready branches by rebasing

## Requirements

- The setup for the user should be easy and avoid too much boilerplate
- It must allow and preserve signed commits
