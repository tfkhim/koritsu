# Progress

## What Works

- Initial project structure and Memory Bank documentation setup.
- Receiving and basic processing of GitHub `workflow_run` events via the `/github/events` endpoint.
- Deserialization of relevant `workflow_run` payload fields.
- Basic logging of workflow name and status.
- Integration tests for the `/github/events` endpoint.

## What's Left to Build

- Full implementation of the core GitHub application logic (checking CI status, merging branches).
- Command Line Interface (CLI) tool.
- GitHub API integration facade.
- More comprehensive testing, including testing the logging output.

## Current Status

- Progressing with core GitHub application event handling.

## Known Issues

- None identified yet.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

- Initial decisions documented in `project_brief.md`, `product_context.md`, `system_patterns.md`, and `tech_context.md`.
- Decision to use `serde` and `serde_json` for payload deserialization.
- Decision to make the `conclusion` field optional in the `WorkflowRun` struct.
